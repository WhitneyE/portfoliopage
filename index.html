My name is Whitney Eddins. I am an honor roll student at Cody High School.
I particicpate in alot of different clubs and groups during school like:
Women of tomorrow, CAP, Career Readiness and more. On my own time i like to read books,
play in make-up and listen to music. I like doing all those things because it help
calm me down and its fun to me. After I graduate high school I plan on going
to college to major in business. I want to own my own salon thats focused on everything
from nails, hair, fashion, and make-up. I also want to travel the world.
